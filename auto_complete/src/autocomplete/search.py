Search and Scoring Module for Autocomplete System

This module implements the core search algorithms and scoring functions for
the autocomplete system. It provides functions to find matching sentences
and rank them according to the project's scoring criteria.

The search process:
1. Find candidate sentences that match the given prefix
2. Score each candidate based on match quality and position
3. Rank results by score and return top-k completions

Scoring Algorithm:
- Base score: 2 × number of matched characters
- Position penalties: Single edit penalties based on position
- Tie-breaking: Alphabetical order of completed sentence

Key Functions:
    run(corpus, prefix, k): Main search function returning top-k results
    find_matches(corpus, prefix): Find all sentences matching the prefix
    score_match(prefix, sentence, offset): Score a single match
    rank_results(matches, k): Rank and return top-k results

Note:
    This module is currently a placeholder for future implementation.
    When implemented, it will provide the core search functionality
    that the engine module delegates to.

def run(corpus: Corpus, prefix: str, k: int) -> List[AutoCompleteData]:
    """
    Main search function that finds and returns the best k completions.
    
    This function orchestrates the complete search process:
    1. Normalizes the input prefix
    2. Finds candidate sentences matching the prefix
    3. Scores and ranks the candidates
    4. Returns the top-k results
    
    Args:
        corpus: The loaded corpus to search through
        prefix: The text prefix to find completions for
        k: Maximum number of results to return
        
    Returns:
        List[AutoCompleteData]: Ranked list of completion suggestions
        
    Example:
        >>> results = run(corpus, "hello wo", 5)
        >>> len(results)
        5
        >>> results[0].completed_sentence

    Note:
        This is currently a placeholder implementation that returns an empty list.
        The actual implementation will integrate with the scoring and ranking
        functions to provide meaningful autocomplete results.
