N-gram Index Building Module

This module provides functionality for building inverted indices to accelerate
autocomplete search operations. It creates n-gram based indexes that map
substrings to sets of sentence IDs for faster candidate retrieval.

The index building process:
1. Extracts n-grams from normalized sentence text
2. Maps each n-gram to the set of sentences containing it
3. Enables O(1) lookup of candidate sentences for a given prefix

Key Functions:
    build(corpus, gram): Build n-gram inverted index for the corpus

Note:
    This module is currently a placeholder for future implementation.
    When implemented, it will significantly improve search performance
    by reducing the number of sentences that need to be examined.

    Build an n-gram inverted index for the corpus.
    
    This function creates an index that maps n-gram substrings to the set
    of sentence IDs that contain each n-gram. This enables fast candidate
    retrieval during search operations.
    
    Args:
        corpus: The corpus object containing all sentences
        gram: Size of n-grams to extract (default: 3)
        
    Returns:
        Dict[str, Set[int]]: Mapping from n-gram to set of sentence IDs
        
    Example:
        >>> index = build(corpus, gram=3)
        >>> index["hello wo"]
        {42, 156, 789}
        
    Note:
        This is currently a placeholder implementation that returns an empty
        dictionary. The actual implementation will:
        1. Extract n-grams from normalized sentence text
        2. Build inverted index mapping n-grams to sentence IDs
        3. Enable O(1) candidate sentence lookup
        
    Future Implementation:
        - Extract overlapping n-grams from each sentence
        - Build inverted index for fast prefix matching
        - Integrate with search module for performance optimization
